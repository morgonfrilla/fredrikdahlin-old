## Introduction
During the spring of 2015 I did my exchange studies in Singapore and NUS. I decided to start a temporary blog to document my experiences and decided to create a blog. I wanted to improve my web programming skills and decided to write one from scratch. This finished version is built on HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, PHP and MySQL. 

## Features
I decided to design the blog as a timeline were each post represented about a month of time and were also put as a navigation bar at the top of the site. The posts then slide horizontaly to match the positions of the posts. 

## Usage
You need to create a database structure to utilize this blog. If you're interested in the database schemas I used you can message me.
